### üîÅ Prank Notebooks Series
Each of the following `.ipynb` notebooks has a different kind of harmless "virus" prank:

1. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 1.ipynb`**  
   - This script is engineered to flood your default web browser with an extremely high-frequency bursts of URLs. Specifically, it attempts to open website links at an insanely rapid interval of about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds between each tab. That's so fast it practically means "open all at once".

   - Once executed, you will likely experience an instant and overwhelming flood of browser windows/tabs opening non-stop. Depending on your system's specs, browser settings, and internet connection, this may cause your browser to freeze, your RAM usage to spike, or your system to become momentarily unresponsive.
   - ‚è≤Ô∏è To CONTROL the SPEED at which each link opens, look for the line that contains time.sleep(...). The number inside sleep() determines the delay in seconds. For example: time.sleep(1) ‚Üí opens a new link every 1 second (slow & safe) OR time.sleep(0.1) ‚Üí opens a new link every 100ms (moderate speed) OR time.sleep(0.0001) ‚Üí opens links nearly instantly (chaotic)
   - üåê To CHANGE THE WEBSITES being opened: Locate the lines where webbrowser.open() is called. You‚Äôll see URLs in quotation marks like: webbrowser.open("https://example.com"). Replace these with any URLs of your choice. Make it fun by inserting meme links, Rickrolls, or fake search results. For example: webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
