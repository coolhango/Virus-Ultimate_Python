### üîÅ Prank Notebooks Series
Each of the following `.ipynb` notebooks has a different kind of harmless "virus" prank:

1. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 1.ipynb`**  
   - This script is engineered to flood your default web browser with an extremely high-frequency bursts of URLs. Specifically, it attempts to open website links at an insanely rapid interval of about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds between each tab. That's so fast it practically means "open all at once".

   - Once executed, you will likely experience an instant and overwhelming flood of browser windows/tabs opening non-stop. Depending on your system's specs, browser settings, and internet connection, this may cause your browser to freeze, your RAM usage to spike, or your system to become momentarily unresponsive.
   - ‚è≤Ô∏è To CONTROL the SPEED at which each link opens, look for the line that contains time.sleep(...). The number inside sleep() determines the delay in seconds. For example: time.sleep(1) ‚Üí opens a new link every 1 second (slow & safe) OR time.sleep(0.1) ‚Üí opens a new link every 100ms (moderate speed) OR time.sleep(0.0001) ‚Üí opens links nearly instantly (chaotic)
   - üåê To CHANGE THE WEBSITES being opened: Locate the lines where webbrowser.open() is called. You‚Äôll see URLs in quotation marks like: webbrowser.open("https://example.com"). Replace these with any URLs of your choice. Make it fun by inserting meme links, Rickrolls, or fake search results. For example: webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")

    - This code creates blank folders. You can control how many folders it creates, or make the code run forever. All the blank folders will eat up a lot of memory and CPU, thus making the device lag.
   - To stop or delete all folders, do the following: (For Macbook) Go Settings, then General, then Transfer and Reset. This will reset your Mac and delete all data. The above method is for desperate situations, when the choice of deleting the folders are virtually impossible due to the lag. Another method is to run the Counter Code. This will not touch or delete any other data or information on your Mac, and is the safest way to delete all files.
If you do not have the Counter Code, you can consider deleting all the files manually by dragging them to Trash.

   - Rickroll. That's literally it.

5. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 5.ipynb`**  
   - This Python script is designed to generate a zip bomb üí£. A zip bomb is a malicious üòà compressed file that, when decompressed, expands into an enormous file that consumes a vast amount of system resources, leading to performance issues or even crashing the system.
   - The code creates a dummy text file, compresses it multiple times into a zip file, and iterates the process recursively to exponentially increase the size of the resulting compressed file. This can cause systems to become unresponsive when the zip bomb is decompressed, as it can expand to several terabytes or more, depending on the number of iterations and the initial file size.
   - How it works: The script creates a small dummy text file (dummy.txt that contains a large amount of data. The dummy file is compressed into a zip file using the zipfile module. For each level, the script generates multiple copies of the zip file and compresses them again. The number of copies is set to 10, and each iteration increases the file size exponentially. After the specified number of iterations (n_levels), the final zip file is created. The script renames it and outputs the file, which can be several gigabytes in size, despite the initial small file size.


6. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 6.ipynb`**  
   - Updated with a newer, more advanced system version. View the SpamuraiX.py repository for more details.
   
8. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 7.ipynb`**  
   - This Python script is designed to spam messages in WhatsApp. Once executed, it simulates keyboard inputs that will repeatedly send a predefined set of messages to a WhatsApp contact. The script continuously presses the keyboard keys for specific characters to form messages, then sends those messages through WhatsApp's interface.
   - This kind of code can be used maliciously for spamming.
   - How It Works: The script imports pyautogui, webbrowser, and time modules to interact with the user interface and simulate keyboard presses. The script waits for 5 seconds before initiating the spam process. This gives the user time to switch to the intended WhatsApp window. The script repeatedly presses keys in a specific order to type predefined words (such as "you", "are", "an", "idiot") and sends them to the chat. The loop runs indefinitely (up to 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 iterations), sending the same message repeatedly.

9. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 8.ipynb`**  
   - This Python script is designed to generate pop-up message boxes with predefined text üí¨. When executed, it will display a series of pop-up messages with random durations for each message, simulating a prank on the user. The messages displayed can be customized by changing the "Messages" variable.
   - How It Works: The script imports time, webbrowser, tkinter, messagebox, and random modules to handle the pop-up creation and display. The Tkinter library is used to create the pop-ups, while the random module ensures that each pop-up stays open for a random duration between 1 and 10 seconds. The pop-up messages are predefined in a list, and the script will cycle through them one by one. After displaying each message, the program waits a short time before moving to the next message.
   - The pop-ups will show various prank messages like "You have been hacked!" or "Your computer is infected with a virus!" to trick or prank the user.

10. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 9.ipynb`**  
   - Does not work. You need an Geocode API Key for it to work, which they have disabled for public use.

11. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 10.ipynb`**  
    - This Python script is designed to spam messages in WhatsApp, same as number 07. Once executed, it simulates keyboard inputs that will repeatedly send a predefined set of messages to a WhatsApp contact. The script continuously presses the keyboard keys for specific characters to form messages, then sends those messages through WhatsApp's interface.
   - How It Works: The script imports pyautogui, webbrowser, and time modules to interact with the user interface and simulate keyboard presses. The script waits for 5 seconds before initiating the spam process. The loop runs indefinitely (up to 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 iterations), sending the same message repeatedly. Once run, it will start spamming: You are a (Smelly pig, Bad Boy or Monkey). Run this code first before heading to Whatsapp and the person you want to spam. Wait 5 seconds and the spam will start.

12. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 11.ipynb`**  
    - This Python script is designed to open multiple image pop-ups that move randomly across the screen, simulating a chaotic prank. It also includes the functionality to periodically duplicate these pop-ups, creating a more disruptive effect. Additionally, the script plays audio from a YouTube video in the background to further enhance the prank experience. This type of code is typically used for pranks, but it can be disturbing to the user and may cause frustration.
    - How It Works: The script uses Tkinter for creating the pop-up windows, PIL (Python Imaging Library) to handle the images, and requests to fetch images from a URL. Pygame is used to play audio from a YouTube video. The script ensures that the pop-up windows move to random positions and periodically create new pop-ups. The pop-ups display a specific image (in this case, a funny image of Osaka) and are set to duplicate themselves at regular intervals, creating a chaotic effect.

14. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 13.ipynb`**  
    - Web Browser Opening: It opens a new browser tab with Google initially (www.google.com). After a brief delay, it types out the phrase "your pc has been hacked pc will update to clear virus" using the pyautogui library, which automates keyboard input. This could mislead the user into thinking their system is infected.
    - Fake Update Page: The script then opens a link (https://fakeupdate.net/win10ue/), which directs the user to a page designed to simulate a Windows update. The script uses the pyautogui library to press the F11 key, presumably to enter full-screen mode on the browser, making the fake update appear more legitimate.

15. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 14.ipynb`**  
    - This code will intiate a double tap every 5 seconds. You can change how fast every double tap occurs under time.sleep.

16. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 15.ipynb`**  
    - Prompt for Name: The program first asks the user to enter their name using pyautogui.prompt.
    - Question Prompt: Then it continuously asks the user if they consider themselves "dumb" with a confirmation popup, providing the options Yes and No. If the user clicks No, the program simply asks the question again.
    - Alert Message: If the user clicks Yes, the program will show an alert with a message like: "HAHAHA (Name) You're dumb as hell!", using the name the user entered earlier.

17. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 16.ipynb`**  
    - This code implements a simple graphical interface using tkinter for a "Gay Test" in a somewhat humorous and inappropriate way.
    - How the Script Works: GUI Setup: The program creates a basic GUI using tkinter with a window of size 600x600 pixels and sets the background color to white. The window title is set to "Gay Test," and a label asks the user, "Are You Gay?" with a large font. Two buttons are created: Yes and No.
    - Yes has a fixed position, and clicking it calls the no() function.
    - No starts at a fixed position but moves randomly when the mouse cursor enters its area. This is achieved by the motionMouse() function, which updates the button‚Äôs position to random coordinates within the window.
    - If the user clicks the Yes button, a messagebox pops up with "Gay Spotted." The program then exits with quit(), stopping the execution.

18. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 17.ipynb`**  
    - This code is a basic "Love Calculator" program that calculates a "love score" based on the number of occurrences of certain letters in the concatenated names of two people.
    - How the Script Works: The program asks for two names (your name and your lover's name), and these inputs are concatenated to form a single string name. The program converts the combined name string to lowercase using name.lower() to make it case-insensitive. It counts the occurrences of the letters t, r, u, e, l, o, v, and e (from "TRUE LOVE") in the combined name. It then sums up the counts of the letters "TRUE" and "LOVE" separately. The program creates two scores: first_Score (based on the letters in "TRUE") and second_Score (based on the letters in "LOVE"). These two scores are combined into a string score.
    - Evaluation Of Results: If the score is less than or equal to '10' or greater than or equal to '90', the program prints: "You go together like coke and mentos." If the score is between '40' and '50', it prints: "You are alright together." Otherwise, it prints the score and a generic message.

19. **`run this code if you are not gay it's just a game chill 18.ipynb`**  
    - This script uses the pyautogui library to move the mouse cursor randomly on the screen for a specified amount of time.
    - How the Script Works: The script imports the necessary modules: time for timing control, random for random number generation, and pyautogui for controlling the mouse. The pyautogui.alert() displays a prompt to the user with the message "Click Here." The function move_mouse(how_long_in_seconds) moves the mouse cursor randomly across the screen for a specified amount of time. It calculates the total time elapsed and moves the mouse to random x, y positions within the screen dimensions (xsize, ysize). The pyautogui.moveTo(x, y, duration=0.2) command moves the mouse to a random position over 0.2 seconds. The loop continues until the specified how_long_in_seconds has passed.
    - Execution: After the alert appears and the user clicks "OK," the script proceeds to randomly move the mouse for 120 seconds (2 minutes) by default. You can adjust the move_mouse(120) function call to any number of seconds you wish.

    - Designed to delete all the .txt files in a specific directory (Text_files).
    - How the Script Works: The variable path is set to "Text_files", which is the directory where the script will search for .txt files. The os.listdir(path) function returns a list of all files and subdirectories in the specified directory (Text_files). The for loop iterates over each file in the directory. For each file, the script checks if its name ends with the .txt extension. If a file has the .txt extension, the script constructs the full file path using os.path.join(path, file) and then deletes the file using os.remove(file_path).
    - Confirmation: After deleting each .txt file, the script prints a message like "File deleted: [file_path]" to confirm the deletion.
